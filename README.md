# SpellChecker
Checks if a word is misspelled by one character.


Assumes the file that is read in is named "english3.txt".
<br><hr>
Currently, it only checks if one single character of a word is misspelled. In the future, I want to make it so it can check if numerous characters are misspelled and asks the user which word it is they were trying to spell. In essence, I want to mimick what one would find using google or while texting.
